# What is a mapping?
Mappings files are used to map the patches to Lunar Client's source code. Mappings needs to be updated each Lunar Client update. Those mappings are `.stm` files. (STM stands for **S**olar **T**weaks **M**appings).

# How to use / update them?
If Solar Tweaks told you to update your mappings, you can do so by downloading the latest stable mappings file [here](https://github.com/Solar-Tweaks/SolarTweaks-Mappings/releases/latest).

Once you dowloaded the file, you can open up Solar Tweaks and click on the `Settings` button (Which is marked with a gear next to the Discord button).

When the settings menu is open, click on the green button called `Import from file` like on the image below. And then choose the file you just downloaded and press `Choose`.
